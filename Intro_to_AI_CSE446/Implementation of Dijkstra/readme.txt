The code has been written in Python 3.4.3 Shell in
Ubuntu Operating System. The Python shell was
available with the operating system.

The algorithm implemented is Dijkstra's Graph Search
algorithm which solves the problem of uniform cost
searches of a tree graph. The distances between
the cities in the input1.txt can never be negative,
hence the greedy Dijkstra's algorithm will not fail.

After moving to the file directory of the find_route.py
file through the terminal, I typed 
$ python find_route.py
The program starts running and takes input from the same
terminal in the form:
input1.txt source_city destination_city 
Then the program outputs information of distance and cities
visited in the same terminal and terminates.
I wrote the code in such a way that it is required to keep
the input1.txt file in the same directory location as the
find_route.py file.

In the code, I imported PriorityQueue from queue and
maxsize from sys. I did not install these libraries explicitly.
