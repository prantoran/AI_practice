#### Bayesian Normal

- instead of a clear win/loose reward
    - what if the reward is from a different distribution
        - gaussian distribution
        - poission
        - gamma
    - can apply Thompson sampling to any likelihood distribution
- need to have conjugate priors
- In Bayesian ML, precision is used instead of variance
- precision = 1/variance

- suitable conjugate priors for gaussian likelihood
| Likelihood                        | Conjugate Prior   |
| ---------------------------------:|:----------------- |
| Unknown mean, known precision     | Normal            |
| Known mean, unknown precision     | Gamma             |
| Unknown mean, unknown precision   | Normal-Gamma      |

If ùúè if fixed, we a posterior over Œº only.
    - Gaussian has 2 parameters (mean, precision)

Thompson algorithm remains the same regardless of what algorith you use.
    - extra work is for solving for posterior parameters in terms of prior parameters and data
    - need to find the equations for the posterior
