### Bayesian Bandits / Thompson Sampling

- small dataset -> large confidence interval, & vice versa
- fat -> explore more, thin -> explore less
- confidence intervals based on central limit theorem
    - CLT -> sum of random  variables
        - ~Normal distribution
            - which is why confidence interval is bell-shaped
- confidence interval is a classical frequentist approach
    - not a bayesian approach
- thompson's sampling uses bayes rule
- use conjugate pairs to get rid of denominator (evidence)
    - make bayesian rule into propotionality
- conjugate pairs  
    - special pairs of distributions where we can ignore the evidence
    - the posterior has the same form as the prior
- bernoulli conjugate prior
    - beta distribution is the conjugate prior for bernoulli likelihood
    - choosing a prior 
        - choosing alpha, beta for beta distributions
        - Beta(1, 1) is a Uniform[0, 1]
            - we are not sure, so assign equal probability
- analogy of confidence interval applied to posterior
    - true mean can be anywhere in the range given by the posterior 
        - (weighted by probability mass)
- instead of upper bound, use a sample drawn from posterior
    - thompson sampling
    - instead of picking one value (upper bound), we can make use of all possible values under the distribution (which will get skinnier over time)
