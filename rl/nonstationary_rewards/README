stationarity
- reward always come from same distribution (iid)
what if rewad distribution changes over time?
strong-sense stationarity: entire distribution doesn't change over time
- white noise is stationary
Weak-sense stationarity: only mean and autocovariance don't change
- BTC (Bitcoin) is nonstationary

Dealing with nonstationary reward
- taking the usual sample mean won't work
- use learning rate
- if we use a constant learning rate, we get an exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA)
    - exponentially decay over time
