### Upper Confidence Bound

- lots of data makes us more confident in our estimate
- inequalities:
    - p(sample mean - true mean >= error) <= f(error)
    - f(error) decreasing func
    - Markov inequality: RHS decrease proportional to 1/t
    - Chebyshev inequality: RHS decreases proportional to 1/(t^2)
        - a tighter bound
    - Hoeffding's inequality 
        - decreases exponentially in (t^2)
        - used in UCB1
- provides accurate success estimates for all the bandits
    - unlike optimistic initial value, which gives correct estimate of the best bandit
